                        <h3>What is LeHS?</h3>
                        <p>LeHS is a platform where you can play coding games that teach you HTML, CSS and other aspects of web development. By registering a LeHS account, you can access free games, save your progress, and share your achievements.</p>
                        <h3>When is the next game being released?</h3>
                        <p>We’re constantly at work on new game titles. But given the nature of software development, it’s hard to give a firm date until we’re close to release. Follow us on Instagram or Facebook to stay up to date on news.</p>
                        <h3>Can I share my achievements with others?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, by default your profile is public, and displays your in-game progress and achievements. </p>
