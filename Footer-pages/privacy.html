                        <h3>Who we are</h3>
                        <p>Our website address is: https://leHS.com.</p>
                        <h3>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h3>
                        <p>We use Google Analytics to collect anonymized and aggregated analytics data to better understand the behavior of our users and improve our services. We have enabled the optional setting for IP anonymization for increased protection of user privacy.</p>
                        <h3>How long we retain your data</h3>
                        <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we store the personal information they choose to provide in their user profile including first name, last name, display name, location, and Twitter username. Users have the option to display their profile publicly or set it as private. All users can see, edit, or delete their own profile information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information at their discretion.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, user progress when using the service is saved for their own benefit. Stored data includes levels completed and top scores in educational games, which they can choose to display publicly or keep private on their user profiles. Website administrators, as well as the owner and administrators of groups that the user is a member of, can view this data.</p>
                        <h3>What rights you have over your data</h3>
                        <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
