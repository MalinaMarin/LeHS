        EXERCISE 1
        Print the squares of the numbers 1 - 10. Each number should be on a separate line, next to it the number 2 superscripted, an equal sign and the result.
        Hint 1: Look up <sup> tag. What does it do?
        Hint 2: You should use the <br> tag for line breaks.

        Input code:

        <body>

        </body>





    EXERCISE 2

    Display an image that when clicked will link to the Google search engine(should be opened in a new window).
    The source for the image is: /images/ex2.jpg 
    Hint 1: What attributes does the <a> tag have? We'll definitely need the href one.
    Hint 2: Look up the target attribute.
    Hint 3: You should use the alt attributte as it's good practice.

    Input code:

    <body>

    </body>

    <p>
    Click on the image to be taken to the Google search engine.
    </p>


    EXERCISE 3


        Display three different images. Skip two lines between each image. Each image should have a title.
        The sources for the images are:
        /images/ex3_1.jpg
        /images/ex3_2.jpg
        /images/ex3_3.jpg


    Hint 1: You can insert an image with the img tag.
    Hint 2: This tag has two required attributes: src - specifies the path to the image, alt - specifies an alternate 
    text for the image, if the image cannot be displayed for some reason.
    Hint 3: You should use the alt attribute in every img tag, it's good practice!
    Hint 4: You can skip lines with the <br> tag, you have to do it twice though.
    Hint 5: Title attribute needs to be specified for each image.  


    Input code:

    <body>

    </body>



    EXERCISE 4

    Use the correct HTML attribute to make the second TH element span two rows.

    <td>John Doe</td>

    </body>


    EXERCISE 6

    Display an image that has a border of size 5, a width of 400, and a height of 350.
    The source for the image is /images/ex6.jpg

    Hint 1: Use border, width and height attributes. We should place them in the <img> tag.
    Hint 2: Don't forget about the alt attribute, it's good practice!

    <body>
   
    </body>

    EXERCISE 7
    Specify that the transition of the <div> element should have a "ease-in-out" speed curve.

Hint: Use the transition-timing-function property.

<head>
<style> 
div {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  background: black;
  transition: width 3s;
}

div:hover {
  width: 350px;
}
</style>
</head>

<body>

<div></div>

<p>Hover over the div element.</p>

</body>




    EXERCISE 8
    Remove the transparency of the <img> element when the user hovers over it with the mouse pointer.

    Hint: Set the opacity property to 1.0.


<head>
<style>
img {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<img src="/images/ex8.jpg" width="280" height="280">

</body>



    EXERCISE 9

    Add the following 5 steps to the animation "example":

0% - Set background color to "purple", left position to "0px", top position to: "0px"
25% - Set background color to "blue", left position to "0px", top position to: "200px"
50% - Set background color to "purple", left position to "200px", top position to: "200px"
75% - Set background color to "blue", left position to "200px", top position to: "0px"
100% - Set background color to "purple", left position to "0px", top position to: "0px"

Hint: The % values represents the different stages of the animation. 0% is the start, and 100% is the end.


<head>
<style> 
div {
  width: 180px;
  height: 180px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: black;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}

@keyframes example {

}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div></div>

</body>


    EXERCISE 10
    Specify that the animation of the <div> element should alternate between running forwards and backwards.

    Hint: Use the animation-direction property.
    <head>
    <style> 
    div {
    animation-name: example;
    position: relative;
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
    background-color: black;
    animation-duration: 4s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
 

@keyframes example {
  0%   {background-color: purple; left:0px; top:0px;}
  25%  {background-color: blue; left:0px; top:200px;}
  50%  {background-color: purple; left:200px; top:200px;}
  75%  {background-color: blue; left:200px; top:0px;}
  100% {background-color: purple; left:0px; top:0px;}
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div></div>
